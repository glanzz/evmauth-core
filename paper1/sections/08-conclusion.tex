\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented time-bucketed balance records, a data structure for tracking fungible resources with heterogeneous time-to-live values under bounded storage constraints.
Our approach discretizes time into $k$ buckets, coalescing deposits with similar expirations to bound storage while guaranteeing that resources never expire before their configured TTL.

We proved three key properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Storage is bounded by $k+1$ records regardless of deposit frequency.
    \item Actual expiration time is always at least the configured TTL.
    \item Adversaries cannot increase operation costs beyond $\bigO(k^2)$.
\end{enumerate}

Our Solidity implementation demonstrates practical efficiency, with gas costs bounded by the configurable parameter $k$ rather than growing with deposit count.
The approach generalizes beyond blockchain to any resource-constrained system managing expiring fungible resources.

Future work includes formal verification via proof assistants, cross-chain extensions, and adaptive bucket sizing for dynamic optimization of the precision-storage trade-off.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By
participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to:
[opensource@radiustech.xyz](mailto:opensource@radiustech.xyz).

## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs, feature requests, and documentation improvements.

Please use our issue templates when creating a new issue:

- **Bug Report**: Use this template for reporting bugs or unexpected behavior
- **Feature Request**: Use this template for suggesting new features or enhancements
- **Documentation**: Use this template for reporting issues with documentation

These structured templates help us gather the information we need to address your issue efficiently.

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/evmauth-core.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`
4. Make your changes
5. Run `forge fmt` and `forge test` to ensure code is formatted and tests pass
6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `style:` Code style changes
- `refactor:` Non-bug-fixing code changes
- `test:` Test updates
- `chore:` Build process updates

## Pull Requests

We have specialized templates for different types of contributions. When creating a pull request, choose the template that best fits your contribution:

- **Default Template**: For general changes
- **Feature Template**: For adding new features
- **Bugfix Template**: For bug fixes
- **Documentation Template**: For documentation updates

You can select a specific template by adding `?template=template_name.md` to your PR creation URL. For example:
`https://github.com/radiustech/evmauth-core/compare/main...your-branch?template=feature.md`

All pull requests should include:

1. Clear title following conventional commits
2. Detailed description of changes
3. Reference related issues
4. Update documentation
5. Add tests
6. Update CHANGELOG.md
7. Ensure CI checks pass

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/installing-solidity.html)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:evmauth/evmauth-core.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd evmauth-core
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```sh
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-foundry-upgrades
```

## Running Tests

It is highly recommended that you run the formatter, clear the cache, recompile the contracts, then run tests with detailed output (i.e. execution traces for all tests + setup traces for failing tests):

```sh
forge fmt && forge test --force -vvv
```

To just run all tests, simply use:

```sh
forge test
```

Add the `--force` flag to clear the cache and recompile the contracts first:

```sh
forge test --force
```

To run tests with detailed output, use the `-vv`, `-vvv`, `-vvvv`, or `-vvvvv` flag:

```sh
# Print logs for all tests.
forge test -vv

# Print execution traces for failing tests.
forge test -vvv

# Print execution traces for all tests, and setup traces for failing tests.
forge test -vvvv

# Print execution and setup traces for all tests, including storage changes.
forge test -vvvvv
```

To run all tests in a specific file, use the `--match-path` option:

```sh
forge test --match-path test/EVMAuth6909.t.sol
```

To run any test function with a specific name, use the `--match-test` option:

```sh
forge test --match-test test_initialize
```

More options can be found in the [Forge Docs](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/reference/test).

## Coverage Reports

To generate a coverage report, use:

```sh
forge coverage
```

You can use the same flags as in the test command to customize the coverage report.

More options can be found in the [Forge Docs](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/reference/coverage).

## Documentation

To generate the documentation site, use:

```sh
forge doc --serve --open
```

This will create a `docs` directory with the generated documentation and open it in your default web browser.

To watch for changes and automatically regenerate the documentation, use the `--watch` (or `-w`) option:

```sh
forge doc -w -s --open
```

To include external libraries in the documentation, use the `--include` (or `-i`) option:

```sh
forge doc -i -s --open
```

More options can be found in the [Forge Docs](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/reference/doc).

## ABI & Bytecode

To generate the full ABI for a contract, use:

```sh
forge inspect src/EVMAuth1155.sol:EVMAuth1155 abi --json > src/EVMAuth1155.abi
forge inspect src/EVMAuth6909.sol:EVMAuth6909 abi --json > src/EVMAuth6909.abi
```

To generate bytecode for a contract, use:

```sh
forge inspect src/EVMAuth1155.sol:EVMAuth1155 bytecode > src/EVMAuth1155.bin
forge inspect src/EVMAuth6909.sol:EVMAuth6909 bytecode > src/EVMAuth6909.bin
```

More options can be found in the [Forge Docs](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/reference/inspect).
